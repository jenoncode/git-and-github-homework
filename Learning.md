# Black Codher Git and Github homework #
<p> I have really enjoyed being part of Black Codher community and I am so grateful for learning to code alongisde women who want to upskill and be financially stable</p>
I am enjoying the coding despite the challenges and I have enjoyed learning different things such as:
- Software development -
-Software Development methodologies -
- Git and Github -
- Command line -
- HTML -
- CSS -
##Challenges##
<p>I have been doing wider reading and watching videos on how to use **visual code**, **command line** and **git and github**. I have actually enjoyed the tasks</p>.  
I have a suggestion which is to have like half an hour to 45 minutes catch up session of the tasks after 8pm. I think it would help those who may not finish the tasks before the lesson.
What would be helpful to my journey is when I am stepping out of the comfort zone such as creating projects for beginners, doing more tasks that will help me get used to VS Code.
As long as tasks are involved using the main front end langauges and we are continuously using git and github that would help me because it helps with my learning.
*Zoom recordings* are really helpful because I a a visual learner as well, it can help me go back and watch them in my spare time to grasp the concepts.
Other than that, I need to understand the git commands and how to use them on windows terminal and know the purpose of it.
